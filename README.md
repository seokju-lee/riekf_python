# Right-Invariant Extended Kalman Filter

This repository contains an implementation of a right-invariant extended Kalman filter [1] in Python.

## How to Run

To execute the code, simply run the following command:

```bash
python3 test.py
```
## Data File

The `data/imu_kinematic_measurements.txt` file used in this project was sourced from the following repository:

[RossHartley/invariant-ekf](https://github.com/RossHartley/invariant-ekf/tree/master)

Please ensure that you have this file in the `data` directory before running the code.
